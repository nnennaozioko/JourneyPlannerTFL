Project Title: Journey Planner Automation

Description 

The Journey Planner project focuses on automating the Transport for London(TFL) journey planner widget. The TFL journey planner widget assists users in planning their journeys within London. The primary objectives of this automation test are to ensure the widget’s functionality in various scenarios:
•	Verifying that a valid journey can be planned using the widget
•	Confirm that the widget is unable to provide results when an invalid journey is planned using the wrong location
•	Check if the widget is unable to plan a journey if no locations are entered into the widget.
•	verify that a journey can be amended by using the “Edit Journey” button.
•	 Confirm that the  “Recants” tab on the widget displays a list of recently planned journeys. 


  Installation Instructions:
I developed this project using the following technologies:
•	.NET Framework
•	Visual Studio(IDE)
•	C#(Language)
•	SpecFlow Extension for integration
•	Seleniun
•	BDD using Gherkin syntax
•	NUnit for assertion
•	Chrome browser
•	Windows 10 operating system


Steps:
•	Installed Visual studio.
•	installed SpecFlow extension for enhanced integration.
•	Created a project named “ Journey Planner.”
•	Installed NuGet packages, including SpecFlow, Selenium, and NUnit.
•	Added Specflow feature files.
•	Wrote Gherkin specifications for the defined features.
•	Generated corresponding step definitions.
•	Implemented Hooks and Page Objects for enhanced automation structure.

During the development and testing phases, several exceptions were encountered, including ElementNotInteractableException and NoSuchElementException. These exceptions were addressed and resolved to ensure the robustness of the automation.

Then GitHub repository is created for the transmission of this project.
